<h3>Reflection</h3>
<p>When I first joined this class I thought it was going to be all about making websites like we did with WordPress and Squarespace. When I heard we were coding I got very nervous. To my surprise I found it a lot more enjoyable than I thought I would. I found how much I really liked it and plan to continue my education with coding after this class.</p>

<h4>Tips and Tricks with HTML/CSS</h4>
<p>I was lucky enough to have a teacher who taught us the basics. If you are curious about coding I would reccomend signing up for freecodecamp.org and also check out w3schools.com for any help with coding! Also be patient with it. It is almost like learning a new language so take time with the basics and gradually learn more at the pace you are comfortable with! </p>
